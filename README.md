PCA + KNN on MNIST

A compact, reproducible implementation that demonstrates how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to compress MNIST digit images prior to classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The notebook/script automatically downloads the MNIST dataset from OpenML and falls back to tensorflow.keras.datasets if OpenML is unavailable. It builds a scikit-learn Pipeline (StandardScaler → PCA → KNN), compares KNN performance with and without PCA, visualizes PCA reconstructions and top PCA components, reports accuracy and per-class metrics, and saves the best models and GridSearchCV results for later inspection.

The repository contains a ready-to-run Jupyter Notebook that loads MNIST (70k samples) via fetch_openml('mnist_784') with a Keras fallback. Two pipelines are used: a baseline pipeline consisting of StandardScaler() followed by a KNeighborsClassifier(), and a PCA pipeline consisting of StandardScaler() followed by PCA(n_components=k) and then KNeighborsClassifier(). GridSearchCV is used to tune KNN hyperparameters such as n_neighbors and weights for both pipelines; the default search grid is intentionally small to keep runtimes reasonable, but it can be expanded for more thorough tuning.

For evaluation and visualization, the notebook prints the best GridSearchCV parameters and CV accuracy, displays test accuracy and full classification reports for both approaches, and shows confusion matrices so you can inspect per-class errors. To give a visual sense of information loss from compression, a small selection of test images is displayed side-by-side as the original images and as PCA-reconstructed images obtained using pca.inverse_transform. The notebook also plots the first N PCA components reshaped to 28×28 so you can see the principal directions (they often look like basis strokes).

At runtime the notebook saves useful artifacts into a results folder. Typical saved outputs include cv_results.csv, the serialized best estimator best_pipeline.joblib (and separate files such as knn_no_pca.joblib and knn_pca_k{K}.joblib for visual experiments), confusion_matrix.png, and explained_variance_cumulative.png. The visual outputs you will see include original test images versus PCA reconstructions, the first N PCA components displayed as 28×28 images, and confusion matrices for both pipelines, which together make it easy to compare the quantitative and qualitative tradeoffs of using PCA before KNN.
